# "Gamers like games because they have a defined goal" 

Date: 12-1-2024

Among the slightly more critically thinking population of people who talk about games, one criticism levied against them is this notion that gamers like games because they have a defined goal. And you just have to work towards that goal to succeed. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVGXmafWqY).

There's obviously the subset of people who just think games are total waste of time and gamers are losers or whatever... and to be fair, I can't exactly blame them, but that's not really how you dig someone out of gaming. Personal experience. 

My first real exposure to this kind of reframing of mentality, to put a more positive light on this, was from Dr. K. I think he's really, really great at pulling someone out from a baseline level, but he does have a lot of strong pre-suppositions that I don't jive with anymore, I guess. He mostly just puts out kind of honestly garbage content now, but if you were there back when he was doing lectures and interviews and stuff... even if people say it's "dangerous" or whatever, fuck you, those few years of authentic value are super, well, valuable. 

Basically, he's one of the good "Internet Daddies" ðŸ˜Š

Then you have the self help influencer axis that shifts slowly down to redpill-ish mentality and you're just like... ahh.... yeah man, you're just ending up repeating the same useless garbage under the guise of "self help" because you enjoy some old guy yelling at you to clean your room. Aight man. 

Anyways, hard to describe the inner world of a terminally online dude. Basically, I'm saying, I'm going to argue this essay from the charitable perspective of Dr. K's eloquent words, whereas you'll frequently see charlatans take on this mantle w/o an actual principles and just use it as an excuse to push their agenda. So go watch Dr. K's video if your brain is brainrotted from internet "self help" gurus. If you aren't, then you've probably had a healthy upbringing, so congrats!

Anyways, I think people have a point, in that when you're a kid, you really don't know how to think for yourself, you just do the thing in front of you without question (and when you're an adult, you just don't have the bandwidth a lot of the the time to question it...). And that can be a **very** good thing - it's unbridled curiosity at its core. 

But it's also such an oversimplification. This applies to games like RPG's or games like clash of clans, where the whole point is to essentially hoard wealth. Okay, fine. Yes, I've played games like Realm of the Mad God, lost a few years to that. These games are one of the categories of all time. 

But I played BTD Battles KOTH in 7th grade, bro. I learned competitive Roblox Swordfighting, FFS. I know other kids around this age that also got into competitive games. And I'd imagine those of you who've played things like Rhythm games or Tetris have treated it as a true learning process as well. 

And then I also played league of legends. I learned macro, micro, etc. But I'd also have 12 hour rage queue braindead afk times. 

And then I learned Minecraft Speedrunning. Those were some truly horrendous days - I mainly just did runs, not really practicing specifics or mechanics, so I stagnated pretty hard. 

Then came competitive programming. If I could go back in time, I would tell myself, don't be afraid to read editorials, it doesn't make you a cheater or make you dumber, and have someone feed you interesting problems. Oh, and be more social, but that's already kinda hard :/ I lowkey strugle to talk about competitive programming, probably because I haven't tried to do any proper "chilling" before. 

And between May - July 2024, Touhou. For the first time in my life I think, I grinded something truly with intention, and I did get a Touhou LNB, it might've killed my love for the genre though lmao.

Anyways, I guess my point is that it's not that gamers need defined goals, it's that when you're a kid, you don't know what the hell it takes to get to where you want to go. And even worse, because you haven't gotten good at anything independently, it's pretty scary. 

In all of these competitive circles, one thing I always heard was "just play more", and I really don't want that to be normalized anymore. I don't think you can change this by just begging the community to be better, it's up to developers to change that.

But you can't make money under this model :sobbing:

At least in competitive programming, you have things like careers and stuff to dig you out, and you have to become pretty good at some fundamental 101 or 201 math/CS to do competitive programming anyways, so it's sort of seen as a more okay endeavor. But like idk man

I think this is why Shmups were such a breath of fresh air to me, being a rare scene that not only embraces practice tooling, but has a culture of creating their own games, and has a thing such as legacy skill! Shmups being quick bites of fun too also makes it seem a lot more like competitive programming in that regard, where you have a single, elegant, transferrable skill, and you're just solving problems with it, sharing cool things, etc. 

In a few years, after leaving the infant-now-toddler MC Speedrunning scene, I'd see the flourishing of countless practice tools and new strategies being developed, which I think is very cool. Ranked speedruns are a thing now, and it's branched off into its own little sport besides just speedrunning, which is a **great thing**. It also helps that speedrunning is a subset of minecraft, and chances are if you get cracked at speedrunning you're gonna be good at other parts of minecraft and vice versa, so in that sense, it tests real, transferrable skills, even if it's just in minecraft, which I think is very cool microcosm of the real world somewhat. 

# Take 2

Ya, even when typing this I realized this is a really unstructured mess. I guess what I mean to say is, that gamers don't inherently like games because they have a defined goal if you just look at competitive games. Games that require real reflection, real mastery, etc. The community moves in general, towards progress and innovation. 

But at the same time, you have millions of people who just afk braindead play the game to get away from life responsibilities, which I get. I've done that for thousands of hours as well (along with social media...)

Well, not the social media part, but the gaming part I think fundamentally deals with the fact that, for example, in real life, if you like a specific part of basketball, it's granular enough to where you can enjoy that specific part. Whereas if I want to play league of legends to enjoy a specific feeling, I can maybe get that feeling a few times an hour at most. 

So in part, it's the "fault" of the developers for surrounding something with a bunch of bloat, but at the same time, like, you can't really make a game out of just a game mechanic...

There's an essence of games, an essence of mastery that can be drawn out that people like, no different than someone enjoying a sport or a subject, and gamers can naturally unlock that part of games, but for some reason we gatekeep it. 

This post is pretty incoherent. This actually came up because I was rewatching NGNL and that line came up, and I realized how wow, that idea was seeded back into my mind even back in 2014. 

And it's just like, it's really not true. 

I'd wager the real issue is that failing in real life, when it comes to real people, hurts a lot, lot more than failing in a game, because games feel like lower stakes and also some biology nonsense when it comes to real people.
