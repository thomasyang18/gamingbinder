segfault on surface.h 

this guy didn't add a debug flag, and i cba to look through the makefiles and manually change everything to not debug, so it appears that some things are being optimzed out? it's making it pretty annoying to keep track of the stack frames when they all get compressed due to O2

chatgpt is a great help, just tell it to give short responses and its really handy 

at least at my internship the code was somewhat understandable....

whatever, comes with the software engineering job :sob: 

coding math all suspicious

sorry, it's just so hard to keep motivated
