I have no idea what function is calling what, I don't know why the hell "surface.h" was failing when gdb said it was just some parsing function, there was some really suspicious buffer thing going on. This is 2006 c++ code, after all. 

I just ended up rewriting that function. Now the issue is that kanji font isnt loading properly; I disabled text rendering entirely and now I don't know what's going on anymore, which probably isn't a good idea... 

This UI is insane, and I forgot how much of a pain UI can be. Ideally the VM is simply a machine that you can query the current state, and rendering is done super simply, though I think I'd like to read a bit more about how game engines work to see if that kind of framework is a legit approach or if its just way too inefficient. 

Still interesting.
