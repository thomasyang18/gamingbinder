Okay my last post about this was a mess, after (brainrotting by) watching Asian Sensation :D I realized this thing. 

The ideal game situation for growth is precisely when you're 50/50. It's not too easy nor too hard. 

Yet we always want to win, which invariably involves exploiting mistakes or knowing "the trick". 

Like winrate isn't really a good metric of how much improvement you're getting, since you're just stomping guys weaker than you. 

I dunno, I guess I got the thought of, "lol this grown man is beating up literal children in this children's game" and sure you can make fun of that, but this concept applies to pretty much everything when it comes to online PvP.

It's different in person, because in perosn, you can't go through hundreds of matches in a week usually. And plus you're playing with the same people, forming a community that's not all about just outplaying or being better than the other person. 

Singleplayer games also lead themselves more to theory building, which facilitates community, whereas PvP games, while they have community, often are 'just grind lol' because yeah everybody's competing, and people like to thrive in that enviornment. 

I dunno man. I guess on the flip side, when competing against a human in real time, there's just that human element that makes it so fun. And sure, you're gonna sift through a ton of just bad games, but you'll find that one good game against a great opponent that you really remember.

Just like how in singleplayer things, you'll have to sift through a lot of garbage content before you find the good stuff. 

(For some reason that reminded me of rock climbing, lol)
