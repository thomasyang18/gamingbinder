# Avoiding Brainrot

Date: 12-2-2024

- I need money to survive. 
- I need to work to make money. 
- Work takes time, which can't be put to my hobbies.
- If my hobby does align with work, either other factors will extinguish it or it's rare anyways. 
- Kids, chores, adult stuff, etc. take time
- Hobbies generally generate 0 economic value intrinsically (and again, nor do you want it to, a lot of the time).

So there's tradeoffs here. 

People generally stick to the hobbies they had as kids. Or they pick up hobbies for some ulterior motive (sports = healthy, competitive programming = programming interviews, reading = smart, social activity, etc.). 

Or, they eliminate hobbies and go down the path of relentless self improvement for the sake of their future self, fine. 

So where exactly does this leave somebody, who's not special in any way, who's unlucky, and doesn't want to spend that much time? It seems like there's just no decent way to guide them to play your game mindfully as opposed to say, doing anything else? e.g.

- brainrotting w/ social media, non-mindful gaming, etc.
- being social
- athletic hobbies
- more physical hobbies (cubing, knitting, etc.)
- intellectual hobbies (reading books, math, etc. )
- working on something that will give them money in the future

Is it just completely morally bankrupt to guide someone down the gaming route at any stage in life?

But the thing is, you can brainrot in any activity you so desire.

I mean, I certainly brainrotted on CP for a while, and I'm not even sure if I'm brainrotting on CP now, though I am constantly seeing and learning new ideas and trying to write up on them. But there are just so many junk CP problems out there, that I don't even know how to begin to group up and classify. Is there even a point? 

College itself definitely doesn't save you from brainrotting. I mean, I've learned that from high school already. Though I might've turned the complete opposite way by avoiding college entirely ; I could've definitely tried taking more interesting courses (especially math), but like... I don't even know what I want right now at this point, and it certainly isn't a lot of the courses I "wish I knew more about". Like for example, I wish I knew more about OS.... for the job prospects and money, not because I'm especially interested. But maybe it will pay off in the future? I dunno. Took the course, have some shitty mental models for it. 

I think the only thing that really can possibly save you from "brainrotting" is by continuously trying to form some, coherent framework about something, and **especially writing it down**. I think one thing I really like about competitive programming is that I can instantly backlink to some cute problem and refer back to my code. But even more than that, trying to re-create how you came to that conclusion is important, so writing down your thought process is important too. 

I don't think most of our writings are going to be amazing, unfortunately. It doesn't really have to be though. People like Paul Graham write essays all the time, and yes, they're well spoken, but they're obviously not as difficult as any text you're going to read in college.

Brainrotting is really just a mindset difference of being intellectually open and curious versus not, IMO. And really being honest with yourself and others about whether you're actually there to learn or are you just done right now. And both are fine; I think, at least in America, there's this "GAS-GAS-GAS" mentality of you have to be working super hard and grinding and shit (in college, that'd be grinding your courses and stuff) and I'm just like... I'm sorry, I'm very much an average, run of the mill dude, so the gaslighting of "if you're not 100% you're failing" is just not it chief. 

Plus, if you were really giving it 100%, why the fuck would you be doing CP or gaming? Go do something financially useful, lol.

So where does this all tie into gaming. Basically no activity is safe from a brainrotting mentality, but at least some activities provide peripheral benefits that can justify its existence. Not only is gaming one of the easiest thing to brainrot in (dopamine, unfortunately, does factor in here), its also just like, 0 actual benefit besides "feel good". Like reaction times is a cope benefit.

I'll try to make comparisons between gaming and CP wherever I can to clarify my comparisons.

# Shoulds

## Player generated content

# Should Nots

## NO PVP

You could make a good PvP game. I can't. Set aside the issue of stress, and the issue that it's an arms race in increasing obscure technology. You need a good matchmaking system to train against the best players

Yes, leaderboards like speedrunning for example, also have this issue. But you also can just enjoy the game mostly normally. For example ,ranked minecraft speedrunning is technically against other players, but you're just playing your game. I dunno, the more solitaire or cooperative the experience, the better as opposed to competitive (though competitive minecraft is still super fun! Ever play capture the wool? ). 

Instead, having a culture of player-generated maps to show off creative techniques for players is almost always a better strategy IMO. That's how it's done on codeforces. It's like a puzzle hunt, except with a specific context - be it CP, or your game. 

(Though I don't know about things like minecraft escape rooms... the issue with that is complexity arises from, well, complexity, instead of creativity. Just having 200 item combinations isn't really interesting. Things like insane hitbox glitching, for example, are more impressive; see Kenadian)

# Why would I not just brainrot on social media or YouTube? 

I'm serious, one thing I've done over the years is replace gaming with social media and YouTube, which is just a net loss. Gaming's literally just better than doomscrolling social media and youtube all day, plain and simple. You'll never change my mind on that. 

Although when you're beating up bots, or playing casually, or doing easy runs you already know how to do, etc. you're 

Even now I just spent a few hours just mindlessly scrolling social media and YT.
