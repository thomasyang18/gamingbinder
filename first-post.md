oml :skull: I have 16 damn drafts in this folder right now, each of which could be a huge essay on its own if I bothered to sort out my thoughts, so I'll just start somewhere small here and get something out. 

I was going to say that nobody, not even gamers, really bother taking games seriously, but actually this is true in a lot of fields. 

- Why would anybody care about your book/movie critique? Yet people still write them. 
- Why is your guide better than others? (often a problem in the CP community lol)
- Academia (lol)

For me at least, if I want to really generate proper value for myself, I can see a life where I just literally afk and do the bare minimum to get by.

At the same time, I've always hated the poltiics that come inevitably when dealing with other people and accumulation of resources, fame, etc. 

So to make this kind of blog, you really have to just intrinsically believe that your ravings will pay off in the future. 

How? I don't know. Do I want to build up to something great? Or just vent? I'm not sure. 

## okay lol 

It's hard enough with competitive programming and math ideas, it's even harder once you introduce all kinds of philosophical and moral ideas, balanaced with the practaclity concerns of real life.

I just re-skimmed my post and I have no idea what I'm talking about, it's like I'm just super scared to be judged for my ideas lol. Not everything has to make total, logical sense, I just need to put my intuition for how things should be out there for these topics. Lay out the foundation first, is the most important thing, before getting into the fluff.
