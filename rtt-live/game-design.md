# Bad things about btd battles: 

- Optimal packing is just annoying
- Micro can get unnececssarily annoying when you have screens full of towers
- No automatic farm collection
- Actually, the idea of farms in general... 
- Eco sucks because you can't invest all of your money into it like you can farms 

# Good things 

- Eco rushes vs kill rushes
- Camo leads, actually. Controversial for me but I think yeah, camo bloons and camo leads r good.
