# Start

Man, today is the day of trying out a bunch of things, aint it? 

---

First of all, this skill, I think, is actually going to be useful. Not necessarily monetizable, but if I learn these skills, **definitely will contribute to career**. So that's good. 

(Well, I'm not sure if it will ultimately in the end; however, I claim that I want to be a "low level programmer", then this is one way I can bite the damn bullet already). 

(thiking about it, there's aint no way this will contribute to my career. might contribtue to my understanding of networking & low level programming though. not like that's useful in 2024)

So, proposal:

# Proposal

Basically re-create BTD battles system, but the idea is that: 

- add customization for bloons coming on screen (this comes out later)
- formalize micro, placement and selling itneractions
- replay system (this comes out later)
- network sync is very important, need to think of a better solution to that. 

Network operations are also an important and interesting thing, since if your opponent dies on your screen, like, that doesn't inform your decision making well. 

That makes me curious as to how starcraft for example has proper syncing. 

I dunno, is that literally just it? Learn network programming and shit, woo. 

# Caveat

I think there's no real solution to the latency issue, like if you don't want constant lag, I think the simulations going out of sync is fine, but it definitely leads to some "bullshit" feelings when your opponent just dies randomly. Given how critical that information can be in games, like idk. 

# The build approach

Get a basic version of the game working, and test it w/ multiple frameworks and engines to see if we can get the desired output ASAP. 

Is this rewriting a lot of code? Sure. But whatever, assets can be reused, the main important point is nailing down the barebones logic and the core of it all.
