Wow, I got sent into a spiral by reading the term, "Nobody wants to date a couch potato". LMAO 

For competitive programming, general programming, and these binders, etc. now I'm brimming with ideas. It's easier to be crushed by the weight of my own expectations than it is to find something interesting to do now. I really hope that I'll never get bored or burnt out from these things one day (it may happen if my cognitive abilities just start declining... hopefully they haven't already). There's just a ton of things to do, and especially with ChatGPT to clarify any basic misunderstandings and conceptions, it's like, wow, learning about this stuff has never been this fun.

Caveat

For things like reading books... I mean, this activity really depends on the quality of information, right? I've become far, far more cynical of just the quality of information out there, and to no fault of other people. Like, my blogs are actual word vomit, negative value to most people, but they help put my thoughts into words somewhat and may lead to some future projects once I have a base, y'know? 

So I'm mostly focused on the "doing" and "generation" part; retrieval is very important too but like information overload especially for beginners is often just bad.

Then let's take something like knitting. I picked it up in response to a hackernews thread, and ngl I still feel like a couch potato, and while there was some initial excitement about really being able to learn stitches and get an intuitive feel for what knitting is... at some point I'm just like, I'm done. 

It's weird because the knitting lore is deep, I'm just not interested, probably because I haven't spent enough time on it. The action that I have to take here is just like, do it, it's not really a resource constraint.

Now we go to fitness. Ahh, fitness. 

Reasons why I don't do it? I get sweaty, it's tiring, I don't have a good home gym setup and don't want to go out of my way to go to the gym, I hate machines, barbells less so but still annoying. I want to just do normal training. Probably among a lot of other things. 

These are all actionable steps I can take to fix (besides just "suck it up"). If it's sweaty, then just have workout clothes. If I don't have a good home gym setup, then make room for a simple setup. I hate machines, make my own routine, etc. 

I think I don't like it because I don't have an intuitive grasp on my body. Well, I do, I guess I just don't trust it? I just do my specified number of reps and call it a day. Maybe it'll be more fun if I start to try and listen to my body more instead of just treating it as a routine to check numbers off.

And finally, how do we tie this back to games? Having a wide variety of things you can do within a certain context of a game is what we call "Content". But most games don't really choose to explore their systems too much, probably because most games in the same genre, underlying have pretty much the same system, and we don't really expect the average person to take it that seriously. 

But I guess things like osu! are kind of cringe? Mapmakers and PGC have been around for ages, variety is there, even within a specific genre. It's just like, I think we have this cool base system, and then add on things like rating and shit that just aren't necessary (althoug I'm a hypocrite for caring about CF rating and problem difficulty too XD).

It's not "comfort" per say, it's that more knowledge = less processing power needed to engage with the activity at higher levels = more intuitive creativity? I dunno. I just know that one of my friends doing martial arts and parkour for fun, and getting toned through the proess, is more fun than going to the gym. Though maybe you can only manage that if you have a lot of free time, lol. 

For example, we learn about DP, then we realize it's really recursion with caching, and then we realize some other properties about it, etc. etc. 

We learn stitches in knitting, but it took me a while to realize what was actually going on under the hood with all those operations, and I still barely understand it (though tbf I haven't been doing it for long). 

Fitness routines weren't invented by cavemen as a default, people just did stuff. 

I think the more you can strip something down to the fundamentals and really understand and engage with it, the more you can appreciate pretty much anything. I think humans just really hate it when they get presented the solution immidiately without truly having the intuition behind it. Nevertheless, sometimes it's necessary, and as you grow older as an adult, you either suck it up or are even glad that these productized solutions exist (Certainly the case for me and fitness).
