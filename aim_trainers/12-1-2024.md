I just discovered what kovaaks is. 

Yeah, this is pretty much what I envisioned for my shmup system.

Fighting games have extensive training modes but there's just so many of them and often highly dependent on framedata. Whereas shmups, are very intutiive and obvious. 

And another genre where one raw, important mechanic can be generalized, is FPS's. 

I'll definitely check out the ecosystem surrounding this game, similar to osu.
