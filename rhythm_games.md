# Rhythm Games

I think what unsettles me about rhythm games is specifically, input complexity and hearing complexity. 

In stateful games, obviously the thinking goes into your brain, so it's not input dependent.

In shmups, it's relatively simple? You only have WASD or joystick, a slowdown or move up. The main thing is the visual part, which yeah it's hard to really train that without a ton of practice, but there are still strategies you can do to look out for specific visual cues, and that is an essential part of any shmupper's toolkit. 

In rhythm games, like osu for simplicity, that part of execution isn't really well documented or formalized at all, it's just something you're expected to get good at, even though it's super important. People try to explain but obv it's bad. 

Then obviously once you get to arcade rhythm games it goes way up, the complexity. 

I guess it's more similar to a sport in that regard - complex motion is not really well documented, since you're just expect to build it through good training and habits I guess. A coach can correct your form if they see any preculiarities. 

I guess what I'm envisioning is the creative part that needs to be documented - for CP there's the problem itself, but the subconscious part of problem solving is impossible to document.

For shmups, it can be the pattern and visual cues, but again, the subconscious processing part is important.

For sports, it's just hard to capture all of that. 

In that sense, sports are "harder", I guess? Not really sure. 

But like, for example, I can analyze how a fortnite pro's mechanical decisions are if I slow down. I don't expect to replicate it obviously, but I can analyze it, he placed X at Y, aimed here, etc, and that can lead to concrete improvement. 

So the more feed-backy the output, the more easily you can debug and reason about it I guess. 

I'm forgetting that a digital medium inherently syncs with technology too. With basketball, how the fuck do you really document what happened. Fundamentally in all of those other games, we get replay for free - you don't get replay for sports for free. 

And in that sense that's a pure medium in which you sort of just... learn by doing. 

Ehh, that might be too vague. Like, piano and shit can be formalized and communicated with sheets and stuff. I guess I never seriously started considering these activities until I started thinking about shmups. 

I dunno. I guess the point here is that this kind of information transfer framework isn't theoretically applicable to all walks of life.
