# In favor of "simple", action packed games

Date: 12-1-2024

I think one aspect of gaming that does go underlooked is that feeling of "godliness".

I was originally going to say that all games and competitive activities root back to this, but that's too wide of a bullshit net - feeling part of a group, having fun with friends, exploring new concepts, puzzle solving, relaxing, escapism, etc. there's far too many things that go into gaming.

## League of Legends 

When I played top lane, I played stuff like tryndamere and nasus, who become monster splitpushers in the side lane. I played quite a bit of wukong too, back when he was broken with lethality. But actually my favorite champion was master yi. For the precise reason that you would see just so, so many montages of him just absolutely 1v5ing, especially late game. That godliness stuck with me to the point where I climbed to diamond (admittedly in pre-season lol) on yi top. 

There are plenty of problems with this approach, though:

- Often "feeling godlike" just means you're stomping someone because you have more resources than them. Acquiring resources is also a skill, but like, how fun is that? I guess you can solve this by picking a more skill expressive champion, but that also raises the reverse question: how is shitting on a leona as a zed fun?  
- Playing to be godlike often can result in inting, which in a strategy game, is bad enough for your future self, but for your teammates....

On the other hand, all these caveats makes the reward of solo carrying just that much better, I guess. 

### Do I enjoy the godlike feeling despite all of this? 

Yes. I stop myself from playing because I know I'll get super addicted again, even if maybe 80% of the time it's just not that fun, for that 20% of the time that it is. Even if I'm a 20/0 yi running down a 0/10 leona supp, I'll get a twisted sense of enjoyment from that. Even if the reasons that lead me to being 20/0 weren't hard earned macro or cracked micro, but instead if my opponent was just playing like dogwater that day and fed me some free kills. 

## Fortnite

I personally think fortnite players have some of the most cracked mechanics in the world, but obviously a ton of people have those, so it's dependent on the gamemode (which happens to be BR) for extra strategies. But here, the "godlike" nature of your mechanics shine through fully most of every game. It's very akin to the permascuffle of CoD or rocket league, there's always significant action happening. Sure it can be like league where you just lose because of less resources but skill is definitely way more of a factor. 

[I mean, this video is a perfect example of a context-dependent strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM5qT6DA95M), classic camping in BR. Though obviosuly it only works against top players because they're cracked at hte game too. 

The BR context does give a ton of epic closed off build fights though, which really naturally pushes the mechanics to the absolute limits, which encourages getting good at mechanics more naturally, than say, just a 1v1 match. So there's tradeoffs there. 

It's also PvP and one of the highest skill ceiling games out there right now, so all of those are [natural reasons why people don't like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fILF-X47knM). I feel like if you could somehow make fortnite's cracked mechanics more single-player friendly, it would be great. Though I guess you only get that adrenaline from "what matters". I think this is one genre which could benefit to the transition to smaller games (think about how popular box fights are).

PvP also inherently requires comparing yourself to the current meta. I think one thing good about competitive programming and shmups is that you can improve at your own pace. Like [this is just sad man](https://youtu.be/fILF-X47knM?si=g19XqzfWT558hN9i&t=220). 

(Also, multiplayer games will always be informal and buggy since its a hard problem to solve ;-; )

## CoD Deathmatch-likes, Rocket League, CS-GO

Rocket league, from what I understand, is a really, really high skill game, being a physics simulator at the end of the day. Moving around in 3D with a rocket and proper rotation physics is very, very hard to get used to, as it turns out. 

In CoD and FPS games in general (I personally played the roblox variants like CoR5 and Phantom Forces), there's a lot of skill, but the important thing is that you can kill somebody, even someone significantly more armed than you, in just a second with the proper aim. This makes encounters fast paced, less resource-based, and overall 

(CS-GO, Overwatch, Valorant is another can of worms, being team objective games, but it's usually much better than league still because, well, skill expression. You can't "outskill" a 20/0 yi). 

## Civ 6, Polytopia

Bro, IDK. Polytopia is short enough, Civ 6 will take actual days (I've never completed a civ 6 multiplayer game). 

A guilty pleasure of mine is to just play against the AI. I like this because it doesn't take forever since people don't have to think, and also you can just do a "good enough" strategy a lot of the time and come out on top. 

## BTD Battles

Like, I dunno. BTD Battles is super cool in concept, but in reality, it's a dead game with the same sweat vs noobs problem, plus there's tons of just random ass QOL features that are not implemented because NK moment. Like please, if your game has unnecessary micro, please remove it. 

I really like drain game situations. 

## Dominion, Yugioh, cardbuilders

As for YuGiOh, there's just so many cards that get released that just up-end the game, even if they're creative. Powercreep since POTE is real. I really love the state machine aspect of YuGiOh and how much interactivity there is, but yeah, the game's broken, unformalized, so money hungry. 

Dominion is a bit more well balanced, but the obsession with trashing and making everything an engine a lot of the game is annoying. Some of the new mechanics are kinda crazy. Again, I like the slog game aspect of dominion, not the "oh both playeres are just rushing to see who's a bit more theoretically optimal". 

There's just a fundamental rule of probability that comes associated with these games; dominion and card builders get away with it by trashing, yugioh gets away by having everything link up with each other (and especially an extra deck for permanent accessabiltiy). 

## Fighting Games

Yeah, I don't know. 

## GunZ, Attack on Titan Tribute Game

These games have really fun movement mechanics. 

"Game development is simple, anybody can do it. What's really at the core is the graphics and animations" 

which sucks because yes, mechanics can be easily replicated, but there's plenty more to a game than just graphics and animations, but it seems like that's the direction AAA studios are headed nowadays... 

## DMC, Tony Hawk 

Hard rating based games. 

## Shmups, Rhythm Games, Tetris

etc. you know the drill

# So here's the thing. 

So this essay, as usual, has devolved completely from the original goal, but this is a mostly append-only blog so whatever. 

There's that feeling of 1v5 that can come from all of those games, and there's learning the fundamentals and being fundamentally a good player. Which I don't know if you can really differentiate, but a game that provides more granularity is better than not. 

Also PvP sucks - great for pushing the limits, bad for singleplayer innovative design. 

I guess I'm really codeforcespilled in how their design process goes even if there's a lot of junk problems.
