# Atomic Chess

Date: 12-4-2024

Thomas, make this a positive post. Remember, when doing a random walk, it's more productive to try and recreate successes than to blame failures. Anyone can criticize, not everybody cna create.

Now this holds a very special place in my heart.

Cheating Story
</summary>

I actually cheated on Lichess before. I was already pretty good, probably the best of my "circle" back then (7th grade or so). I know, I'm so cracked. 

It started on a website called pogo.com. I just simply used a chess engine to beat down people and steal their coins or whatever, so there was an external incentive to cheat.

    Side note, they closed down chess on pogo.com, so sad.

Then I discovered lichess, and I just wanted to see how far I could get with cheating. I didn't realize that Lichess, being an actual chess site, would have actual cheating detection, so when I was flagged, I made a blog post attempting to explain how I was **pretty good**. But obviously there's a world between **pretty good** and **3000 LGM level good**. 

Also, when I made a new account, obviously I had my IP attached, and an admin sent me something snarky like, "I'm glad you enjoy our platform so much :)". That's just creepy. 

I mean... I was like, 12 at the time dude, and obviously I wasn't the smartest of 12 year olds. Actually, to think about it, I might be something of a serial rule breaker - intentionally or not, I got banned from a Minecraft server, chess, and RotMG from the ages of 10-12, on places I've spent considerable time in (I guess chess implicitly since I've been playing for a while). 

- For the minecraft server, I literally didn't do anything wrong
- For RotMG, I did some light trolling for 1 day (impersonating Dhayne and saying "free itenz pls" pretending to be a noob) and got IP-wide permawiped
- For Lichess... there's not really an excuse.

Every single time, the admins basically just mocked me, probably because to them, I was a nefarious loser NEET behind the screen, and not an actual, literal kid. Little did they know... (or perhaps the type of people who feel this way in a decade's time have pretty strong correlation...)

But I guess you don't get to criticize when you're in the wrong. :^). Creepy, powerhungry admins.

After getting bored of normal chess, I discovered atomic chess. I would boot up some games, and play some pretty simple openings. 

```
1. Nf3 f6 2. Nc3 c6
```

etc. 

Then, some anonymous person, destroyed me. I can't remember if I wanted to learn, or if he goaded me into learning through trashtalk, but I remember just playing for hours on end at that point, just trying to learn the traps and tricks that he laid out. I can't remember if I had an official account with atomic rating and stuff. 

Which is so weird, since I had this whole chess ecosystem behind me, for example, and I ultimately put more stake into chess overall than atomic chess (nowadays they're both mostly the same level). 

I'm pretty sure they were an adult (I think I recall them talking about work), and they definitely knew I was a kid; instead of being a normal ass adult and asking for contact information on another website or something, they would stay anonymous, and to confirm that their identity, we would have a secret codephrase. I remember it was something dumb and generic, like "pink elephants" or something? 

Hey, if you think that's cringe or childish for an adult, fuck you. That's cool, and I wasn't groomed, so it's all good. 

So what would happen is that I would be occasionally grinding atomic games, then some really good player will show up. I'll rematch them a few times, say "pink elephants?" in the chat, and we'd quickly get back up to speed. That was fun. 

As for the actual theory, I can remember some crazy but classic variations. A lot of the h6/Nh6 openings could cheese an unprepared player. There was the f pawn push system that somehow worked. There were plenty of classical motifs, involving saccing on g6 with a queen staring down F3, or using threatening moves to get tempo. For example, if black plays d5, you can play Qh5 -> Qe5 -> Qxc7, though in a lot of variations this attack can be countered by a similar attack on the queenside after the sac involving the rook coming down to C3. I forget the exact details though.

I think, this is the first time in my life where I was actively learning something. 

Obviously this kind of relationship isn't feasible everywhere (it depends on high quality, capable individuals, in which by definition, I believe in a pool of people, there naturally will never be, relative to specific percentage tiers) which is why I think great singleplayer play is ultimately the best form, but this kind of learning experience was fun. 

It also helps that atomic chess goes by **fast**. Like within 5 or even 10 moves you already know who's won, it's easy to restart fast. That probably contributes to it more than chess. 

I suppose there's also a maturity aspect in these brain computation games, where there's always going to be theory that you just have to contextually know because you've derived similar patterns before. As opposed to shmups, in which case a superplayer can LNB first try. IDK.
