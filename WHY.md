# WHY

Date: 12-4-2024

Completely unfiltered, dread-filled post :) 

---

Alright, fine. I'll tackle the big issue on the table. 

I'm just thinking like, why I'm even trying to make a game in the first place. It's just objectively a waste of time and space to have a singleplayer game that you need to try in. Why would literally anybody sane play it? 

I mean, I'm doing competitive programming, but I wonder how long that will last now that all the "awards" are gone (which really didn't mean much in hindsight, I should've just focused way more on just having fun solving the problems). 

But it's like, I've played a ton of different games, and I can point to a flaw with each of these approaches:

### Chess

- Effectively what is anonymous matchmaking in tournaments, I **despised** that. Maybe I could've been more social, but man, I wanna be there to have fun. I remember having a nervous breakdown in 4th grade from the "pressure". And like, I didn't even have parents that were pushing me all the time. I'm pretty sure I knew what stereotypical asian parents were like. I think by the nature of immigration selection, 2nd gen asian kids will always get a half-hearted pushing into "getting the bag!". E.g. I was literally just put into some beginner chess classes, and then put into tournaments not long after, and then when I didn't want to do it anymore they just stopped. In that sense:

- passion is very much out of the picture (what I conceptualize as "American") 
- tiger parenting is also out of the picture (what I conceptualize as "Asian)

There's those parents that put their kids into training camps all the time and shit, you know, basically prep school kids, which is actually far more common than I realized; just look at the olympiad communities in high school from well off regions. 

I mean yeah, I recall having some BS college prep and stuff, but it was all half-hearted activity as compared to what I'd imagine the average AA experience looks like.  

From chess, I suppose I got a patience for sitting down and doing nothing for a couple of hours. 

**I suppose one thing I can learn from this is that, I hated books, but I liked playing against myself. I'm not sure how good a kid can be playing against himself, but maybe I can make a system for this? How is this not just a chess bot though (my brother played against chess bots when he was younger)**

I ended up finding refuge in just playing chess variants and chess tactics as I grew older. 

I think I ended up stopping chess because without that innate passion I guess, if you're literally just thrown into a loop as a kid of, "well, go do this club, then go do tournaments" and no adult tells you otherwise, well the only logical conclusion you come to is "I gotta win these tournaments", so yeah, invoking that enviornment of safety to fall back on is very important.

### Miniclip, Early Roblox ( < 2010)

Mindless, brainless fun. Even here though, instead of exploring new games usually, I'd stick to the few fun games I like. E.g. commando assault, stick war, that one zombie tycoon game on roblox. I think even as this young, I was more interested in mastery than variety.

(of course, to any adult looking from the outside, this is all just "time on the machine", and fair, games are useless, but whatever. Maybe it's a big red flag if the only interesting thing I can analyze about life are inconsequential things). 

### Yugioh

I literally never deckbuilt, I just used the deck my brother made for me and optimized it to beat all my friends, who either didn't care or didn't have the cards to beat the deck. Not sure if any lesson can be learnt here besides, "it's easy to fall for these easy dopamine gameplay loops". And like, lowkey I haven't deckbuilt much now, because I find it really unrigorous (maybe it's an art just to be learned), but like, given the resources, it's not a baseline given. Like I feel like it's easy to just accuse games of "haha easy dopamine farm" but like its not 

(Though lowkey it kinda is though, I've spent who knows how many months in college just absolute brainrotting just cuz. Not to mention the years back then)

Maybe on the modern internet it's just easier than ever to find this information though, since all of the infra has been built.

### Bloons TD 

(thanks Daniel Z and Kerry)

Watched tons of SuperJombombo.

BTD5 - I think this was actually a **great example of a singleplayer experience**, plus CO-OP was hella fun with a variety of people (Daniel Z, Kerry, Jin). I would say though that it does definitely get repetitive ; however the BTD6 challenge modes definitely fix that, and I think that is probably ideal gameplay? Though again, I don't like context-sensitive games; the more hardcoded numbers there are, the worse. 

BMC - Prime grind garbage, though contested territory in particular was interesting while it lasted (regrow farming). Idk, anything that ends up ultimately being reptition is bad (though thats basically just CP lmao so I haven't learned my lesson even now, though I guess I am starting to only gravitate towards harder problems instead of really caring about perf, aka how fast I solve questions I already know)

BTD Battles - now this was the shit. I played with friends, sure, but I also got into the KOTH community. Also went back on a spree watching Asian Sensation. This is pretty good; even though it is pretty context sensitive, I think because it's a dead game, but still recieves some balance updates, that the search space is epxlored out. Though no good practice tool so not really a formal effort here.  

### SAS4

Bro, this was bad. This is literally just a dumb grind RPG that I played for no reason. Maplestory, Growstone, okay, fine, that whole year of 2018 was kind of a shit year for me. But bro... like this probbaly highlights peak of what NOT to put into a game. 

I had to just take a step back and doomscroll a bit after remembering this. Dude, it's actually so bad. But whatever. 

I think materialism is bad. Grown from a utility standpoint (it's a hassle to hoard and keep track of "what is yours"), money standpoint (save money), and just idk, most of my enjoyment has been from cheap things? I suppose I'm young and don't need to care much about QoL things though. Also I'm by no means succcessful, that mentality could contribute lmao. 

But RPG's and "online wealth" definitely is something I do not want to inspire in people. Whether that's better than inspiring kids to sweat 12 hours a day on a game that will literally be useless to them in the future... yeah fuck man. I guess I need to look at the osu! community after all. 

### Minecraft

So many stages to this. 

At first I just got it cuz it was the hype with my friends. Also I tried connecting with Donald over LAN, when we weren't even in the same house. I think I'm actually just like, stupid, since that's a quick google search away, but I guess that idea wasn't really formalized even back in 2012. It's kind of crazy how fast technology moves. 

Anyways, I didn't really touch minecraft until I went to speedrunning and Skyblock. MCSR was a fun experience in replicating strategies from scratch - I feel like this kind of thing I've always been doing, but it was for those RPG-like games, but here there was some illusion of competitiveness. I didn't know how to get good at it of course, so I never got good, but it was a fun grind I guess? I think dedicated practice modes would've been better though. 

    - Ehh, is this the case? I was around when practice tools were being developed, I just never bothered to set up something like the 1 cycle practice tool and learn it efficiently, even though it's such a core skill. I suppose this relates back to the granularity thing - minecraft has such variety and tests a ton of skills, just timing bed explosions is a necessary one but boring one. Resetting is also boring AF. On the other hand, fast inventory management, instant reactions, block clutches, etc. are hype as hell.

And skyblock was just brainrot, nuff said. First RPG I willingly had the balls to delete my account though. Still have not done that with realm (because Daniel spent real money on the account so I'd feel bad...)

### RotMG 

Ahahaha, the big clincher. 

Dude, I think this was one of the first genuinely difficult games I've played. Yeah I'm bad at games, it took me 2 months of near constant play (granted it was maybe a few hours a day, given PC privileges time) to even just almost max ONE character. It wasn't until I got a bit better (enough to 0/8 sprite worlds), discovered trading, and really just tried to take the game a bit more seriously that I finally got my first maxed character. 

I still remember the day I drank 22 def and died on my wizard, fuck. Even though that 3 def in hindsight really doesn't matter, that's just me sucking at games. You could make some cheesy story here abot how "it inspired me to always look in the long term and be prudent". Yeah, no, I'm going nowhere in life right now, if anything it taught me to be hyper risk averse and always take (what I percieved) to be safe; for example, I could've taken that knowledge, went, "yeah, I want to get better at bullet hells, not get better at hoarding wealth", and go play some shmups instead, or even better, just abandoned games to begin with, but etc. whatever 

Also, DECA banning a literal middle schooler from your game, go fuck yourselves :) 

### Fortnite, League

idk man, the main issue with this I think is that with anonymous ranked matchmaking, you're not told to operationalize. Dr. K does have a point in that gamers don't tend to operationalize, and I'd say these games are a perfect example - it's so easy to just queue up for months, years w/o actually trying to understand and improve (while not applying any effort to your real life either). 

Maybe I'm just like, the bottom 1% of society that not only is not good at anything, doesn't put any effort towards anything, but worst of all, commits all their time to useless skills in the belief that it will get somehwere, without even getting good at that skill. A complete, utter, lard. 

If this is the kind of person I'm targeting... then I dunno if software can help, probably a friend will help a lot more. 

### OSU! (and rhythm games)

Alright, fucking osu. 

This is probably my main hesitance against trying to make the shmup thing work. 

- People play the game for the songs. How you click the notes is secondary. Nobody's fucking developing a "theory of rhythm games" or whatever. Things are hard to hit because they're hard to hit. Things are interesting to hit because they're interesting to hit. There's no benefit here, obviously not academically/financially, but even from a gameplay perspective, it's just "play the damn game". 
- Osu has mapping ecosystem and whatever, technically anybody can publish (though it's not an official map); what ends up happening is that video gamers are kids, so they submit joke maps and bad maps in general, and overall it's a dickmeasuring contest to get accredited instead of trying to push the medium, I guess? Though maybe the genre is just so simple that there's really nothing much to it besides 'hit better' lmao. 
- Actual useless skill. Like me click circle. No different than shmups. 

The differences are, I guess:

- shmups are mostly about the dodging? Like it's a unique, fundamental medium, as compared to rhythm games which, sure, has music, but has so many iterations of "just hit it to the beat!" 

### Dominion 

Actually, this is a pretty great example. Dominion has a pretty extensive technical community dating back to several decades ago; you can look up opening tutorials and analyses and stuff. And I imagine the crowd of people who like Dominion are the type to have real technical skills, and so implicitly will try and codify this knowledge somewhere. 

There are cultures of kingdom replays, trying to use stats to determine the optimal play, etc. This is just a trust me bro moment, but you can find lecture slides and videos analyzing multiple kingdoms and certain playstyles. There is "literature" on it. 

I think what's so interesting about dominion as compared to other deckbuilders is that, payload, draw, engine, gains are all formalized resources and can interact with each other to not go with the same strategy every time. Whereas with other games, even if I like them, say shards of infinity - it still falls prey to the very very classic, "haha do I bum rush or go eco?? hehehee" like at the same time, I get why games lean in more to the "don't think that hard, just go heuristically" approach, but at the same time... idk. 

I think again though, this suffers from too much hardcoded variety. Most kingdoms, if you generate randomly, are just like... not interesting. And I don't think an algorithm to pick interesting kingdoms would be good either. I mean, the game is inherently interesting, don't get me wrong, and an interesting kingdom certainly doesn't need to be king's court + smithies + infinite actions + infinite gain boards (I actually think those are boring nowadays), but like... idk man. It's not like a CP problem. 

Also dominion is still really niche, simulators are niche, etc. 

## What the fuck? What about your real life, man? 

Ran away from all of it. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing to run away from traditional systems, it's just that, you better supplement it well. 

I dunno, in real life, the obvious, simple solution often just works, probably because it's the hardest, and hard things are (one factor in) how you make a living. Engaging in "improvement" for the sake of improvement in some niche that nobody cares about? Just evolutionary suicide. 

I don't see myself sustainably caring about solving math problems anymore in a few months, which is a shame, as if this is the peak of "spending time getting good at useless activity", then you can't really morally justify anything else, if even that fails. 

Well, I suppose it's not the peak. The sole benefit of CP is that you get better at thinking about clever math/programming tricks. If you do social activities, you get better at socializing. If you get better at sports, you get more healthy, etc. So there's multiple pulls to all of these.

Gaming? Complete anti-social behavior, not in an introverted-extroverted way, no, "social" as in, "what possible benefit do I provide for the social and moral fabric of society", is none. 

So again, I seriously cannot find an imperative to write this software. It's as if gaming has its place at the bottom, and in order to try and rise above its place is just morally wrong. 

Am I actually providing value to the world in any meaningful way, or is this just a technical challenge to try and put on my resume? 

And all of this is just procrastination in getting the project up and running, anyways, so :)  The arrogance to think that I could even make this software and pontificate on the consequences before even making it. 

---

And that's a wrap. Classic Thomas thoughts. I think all of these "dilemmas" could be solved by simply just, doing the work, without a care in the world for all of these other bigger questions. If your idea works, the market will decide. If it doesn't the market will also decide.

^^^ Well that mentality is also something I need to abandon, since by doing that you're never going to create something that's actually useful and that you're passionate about, is what I've realized. You need to have strong opinions on things, because you're trying to say that the world should work like way Y, even if way Y is absolutely braindead retarded. 

It's times like these where I like to invoke the Underground Man. It's nice, Dostoevsky put into words so eloquently that you can just choose to ignore everything - understand that you're miserable, pathetic - and yet still choose to ignore everything. It invokes this kind of utter delusion that resolves all of these valid, basic, grade 1 criticisms a toddler could point out, in a pacifying way. 

I think for the first time in years, I think I see something truly worth making, and I have all these criticisms as to why not to make it, but I think I have some arguments as to why it can be. Well, if it has any merit at least, then I suppose it's better than nothing. 

It's probably not healthy to just put aside basic issues like "who the fuck would want this or play this" though.
